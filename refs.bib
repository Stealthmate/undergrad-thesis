abstract = {Dynamic ride-share systems aim to bring together travelers with similar itineraries and time schedules on short-notice. These systems may provide significant societal and environmental benefits by reducing the number of cars used for personal travel and improving the utilization of available seat capacity. Effective and efficient optimization technology that matches drivers and riders in real-time is one of the necessary components for a successful dynamic ride-share system. We systematically outline the optimization challenges that arise when developing technology to support ride-sharing and survey the related operations research models in the academic literature. We hope that this paper will encourage more research by the transportation science and logistics community in this exciting, emerging area of public transportation.}

abstract="We consider n mobile agents of limited energy that are placed on a straight line and that need to collectively deliver a single piece of data from a given source point s to a given target point t on the line. Agents can move only as far as their batteries allow. They can hand over the data when they meet. In this paper we show that deciding whether the agents can deliver the data is (weakly) NP-complete, and for instances where all input values are integers, we present a quasi-, pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that runs in time O($\Delta$2 {\textperiodcentered}n1{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}4log$\Delta$), where $\Delta$ is the distance between s and t. This answers an open problem stated by Anaya et al.(DISC 2012).",

abstract = {Bike sharing systems have been deployed in many cities to promote green transportation and a healthy lifestyle. One of the key factors for maximizing the utility of such systems is placing bike stations at locations that can best meet users' trip demand. Traditionally, urban planners rely on dedicated surveys to understand the local bike trip demand, which is costly in time and labor, especially when they need to compare many possible places. In this paper, we formulate the bike station placement issue as a bike trip demand prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised feature selection method to extract customized features from the highly variant, heterogeneous urban open data to predict bike trip demand. Evaluation using real-world open data from Washington, D.C. and Hangzhou shows that our method can be applied to different cities to effectively recommend places with higher potential bike trip demand for placing future bike stations.},

abstract = {Rendezvous with detection differs from the usual rendezvous problem in that two mobile agents not only accomplish rendezvous whenever this is possible, but can also detect the impossibility of rendezvous (e.g., due to symmetrical initial positions of the agents) in which case they are able to halt.We study the problem of rendezvous with and without detection of two anonymous mobile agents in a synchronous ring. The agents have constant memory and each of them possess one or more tokens which may be left at some nodes of the ring and noticed later. We derive sharp bounds for the case of at most two tokens per agent and also explore trade-offs between the number of tokens available to the agents and the time needed to accomplish rendezvous with detection.},

abstract="Group search and evacuation are fundamental tasks performed by a set of co-operating, autonomous mobile agents. The two tasks are similar in that they both aim to search a given domain so as to locate a target which has been placed at an unknown location in the domain. However they also differ in that the former terminates when the first searcher in the group reaches the target while the latter when the last searcher in the group reaches the target. Variations where termination is determined by some designated agent have also been considered. Depending on the domain being explored we distinguish linear search when the target is placed on the infinite line and circular search when the target is placed on the perimeter of a disk. The agents move with their own maximum speed, and the goal is to design algorithms that minimize the worst case termination time. Two communication models between the robots are being considered: in the non-wireless (or face-to-face) communication model, robots exchange information only when simultaneously located at the same point, and wireless communication in which robots can communicate with one another anywhere at any time. In this paper we survey some of the most interesting recent algorithmic results on search and evacuation concerning mobile agents with and without faults.",

The second result shows that determining a minimum mean-flow-time schedule in an m-machine flowshop is NP-complete for every m ≥ 2. Finally we show that the shortest-length schedule problem for an m-machine jobshop is NP-complete for every m ≥ 2. Our results are strong in that they hold whether the problem size is measured by number of tasks, number of bits required to express the task lengths, or by the sum of the task lengths.},

Cooperative, adaptive and responsive monitoring in Mixed-Mode Environments
(MMEs) raises the need for multi-disciplinary research initiatives. To
date, such research initiatives are limited since each discipline focusses
on its domain specific simulation or testbed environment. Existing
evaluation environments do not respect the interdependencies occurring in
MMEs. As a consequence, holistic validation for development, debugging, and
performance analysis requires an evaluation tool incorporating
multi-disciplinary demands. In the context of MMEs, we discuss existing
solutions and highlight the synergetic benefits of a common evaluation
tool. Based on this analysis we present the concept of the MM-ulator: a
novel architecture for an evaluation tool incorporating the necessary
diversity for multi-agent hard-/software-in-the-loop simulation in a
modular and scalable way.},

abstract = {Bike sharing systems have been installed in many cities around the world and are increasing in popularity. A major operational cost driver in these systems is rebalancing the bikes over time such that the appropriate number of bikes and open docks are available to users. We combine two aspects that have previously been handled separately in the literature: determining service level requirements at each bike sharing station, and designing (near-)optimal vehicle routes to rebalance the inventory. Since finding provably optimal solutions is practically intractable, we propose a new cluster-first route-second heuristic, in which a polynomial-size Clustering Problem simultaneously considers the service level feasibility and approximate routing costs. Extensive computational results on real-world data from Hubway (Boston, MA) and Capital Bikeshare (Washington, DC) are provided, which show that our heuristic outperforms a pure mixed-integer programming formulation and a constraint programming approach.}
